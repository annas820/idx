# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.7.1] - 2026-10-18

### Fixed

- Release notes: the release workflow stopped at the empty `[Unreleased]`
  heading above the version, so GitHub releases v0.2.0 to v0.7.0 carried
  only the install line. It now takes the version's own changelog section
  (falling back to `[Unreleased]` only when there is none), and the notes of
  every earlier release have been filled in from this changelog.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-10-18

### Added

- idx.co.id provider (`src/providers/idx/`): the JSON endpoints behind the
  exchange's own pages, no key. A Cloudflare refusal is a provider error that
  says so; fixtures in `tests/fixtures/idx/`.
- `stocks foreign SYMBOL` and `market foreign`: foreign buying and selling per
  session and across the market (shares, as IDX publishes them, plus net ×
  close as a rupiah scale). MCP `idx_foreign`, `idx_market_foreign`.
- `market brokers`: every exchange member's day ranked by value, volume or
  frequency. MCP `idx_market_brokers`.
- `bandar broker CODE`: where one broker is a top-10 buyer or seller across
  the most traded stocks (IPOT). MCP `idx_bandar_broker`.
- `stocks actions SYMBOL`: corporate actions from IPOT (dividends, splits,
  bonus shares, rights with ratio and dates), RUPS, warrants and rights.
  MCP `idx_corporate_actions`.
- `market calendar`: the exchange calendar (dividend and rights dates, RUPS,
  public exposes, listings; bonds and buybacks on request), each entry
  classified. MCP `idx_calendar`.
- `market holidays`: bundled trading holidays for 2026 and 2027 (checked
  against IDX's trading-day counts), today's status and the next trading day.
  `IDX_HOLIDAYS` overrides the list. MCP `idx_holidays`.
- `market indices`, `stocks list`, `market members`: the daily index board,
  listed stocks and exchange members from idx.co.id; the last two fall back to
  the bundled lists. MCP `idx_indices`, `idx_instruments`, `idx_members`.
- 33 MCP tools.
- Web terminal: `actions`, `holidays`, `bandar broker` (from the nightly scan),
  `list` and `members` (bundled lists) and `tools`. `help` ends with a button
  for each of the 33 MCP tools; the five idx.co.id tools show their CLI
  command, since idx.co.id refuses requests from the Worker.
- Landing page: a Daftar Perintah table with every MCP tool, its CLI command
  and a link that runs it in the terminal.

### Fixed

- `bandar screen --symbols` offline with nothing cached exits 5 (offline miss)
  instead of 4.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-10-18

### Fixed

- Web terminal: `news`, `sentiment` and `brief` no longer hang when a feed
  accepts the connection and never answers, as Kontan's RSS hosts did. Every
  outbound call of the Worker (Yahoo, IPOT, the news feeds, the ownership
  mirror) now has a deadline that covers the body; a silent news feed is
  skipped for five minutes in favour of its cached copy; and the browser
  reports a request with no answer after 60 s instead of leaving it pending.
- `stocks news`, `stocks sentiment`, `stocks brief` and the matching MCP
  tools: a feed that times out is remembered for five minutes, so later calls
  serve its cached copy (with a warning saying why) at once instead of each
  waiting out `--timeout`.
- Network errors name a timeout as such ("timed out waiting for <url>") and
  carry their underlying cause instead of reqwest's bare "error sending
  request for url".
- npm launcher: a binary download that stops sending fails after 30 s
  instead of hanging the install or the first run.
- `install.sh`: downloads give up after 20 s without a connection or 60 s
  without data.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-10-18

### Fixed

- `broker`: the IPOT summary ranks its top 10 buyers and sellers by lots, not
  by value as the help, the docs and the JSON Schema said. Of two brokers
  the one with more lots comes first even when it traded less value.

### Added

- `idx bandar detect <SYMBOLS>`: bandarmology on the broker summary. For the
  top 1, 3, 5 and 10 buyers against as many sellers: bandar value and volume
  (net value and lots), net as a share of the value traded and a signal
  (`big_accumulation` at +15 %, `accumulation` at +5 %, `distribution` at
  -5 %, `big_distribution` at -15 %), the phase against the price move
  (`quiet_accumulation`, `markup`, `quiet_distribution`, `markdown`), the top
  buyers' share and average price against the last price, foreign flow and
  the reasons. `--period 1d|1w|1m|3m` (default 1w) or explicit dates, `--top`,
  `--investor`, `--board`; `--daily` adds the session-by-session movement
  with its cumulative net and streak. JSON schema `idx.bandar.v1`.
- `idx bandar screen`: the bandarmology screener over the 100 most traded
  stocks by value (`--scan`, or `--symbols`), with presets `big-accumulation`,
  `accumulation`, `distribution`, `big-distribution`, `quiet-accumulation`,
  `quiet-distribution`, `foreign-accumulation` and `below-bandar`, and
  filters on `acc`, `net`, `lots`, `fnet`, `fpct`, `gain`, `chg`, `turnover`,
  `conc`, `price`, `signal` and `phase`. JSON schema `idx.bandar.screen.v1`.
- MCP tools `idx_bandar` and `idx_bandar_screen` (23 tools now).
- Web: `/api/bandar`, `/api/bandar/screen` and `bandar` / `bandar screen` in
  the terminal. The web screen reads a scan the Worker's cron runs after each
  close (from 16:45 WIB) over the session's 100 most traded stocks, a few per
  minute, into D1 (`migrations/0003_bandar.sql`); `/api/bandar/status` shows
  its progress.
- Web terminal: `quote` with a single symbol draws a price chart under the
  table, with ranges 1D, 5D, 1M, 6M, YTD, 1Y and 5Y, a volume strip, the
  previous close on 1D and a crosshair readout of each candle (pointer, touch
  or arrow keys).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-10-17

### Added

- `idx broker <SYMBOLS>`: which brokers bought and sold a ticker. The top 10
  buyers and top 10 sellers by value from Indo Premier's (IPOT) public broker
  summary, each with the broker code, name, class (local, foreign, BUMN),
  lots, value and average price, plus the range's total value, lots, average
  price and foreign net value. `--date`, `--from/--to`, `--investor
  all|foreign|domestic`, `--board all|regular|cash|negotiated`, up to 10
  tickers per call; without dates each ticker gets its latest session with
  trades. JSON schema `idx.broker.v1`; `-o csv` writes one row per broker.
  The source rounds figures of a million and more to one decimal, so those
  summaries carry `rounded: true`.
- `data/brokers.csv`: IDX's exchange-member list (89 brokers), bundled to
  name the codes.
- MCP tool `idx_broker` (21 tools now), `/api/broker` and a `broker` command
  in the web terminal.
- Web: Open Graph / Twitter share card, canonical URLs, JSON-LD,
  `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml` and an apple-touch icon on
  ihsg.midoriresearch.com; API responses are `noindex`.

### Changed

- Package metadata and the licence credit Midori Research
  (desk@midoriresearch.com) instead of a personal name and address.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-10-17

### Added

- Published as **`ihsg-cli`** on crates.io (`cargo install ihsg-cli`) and npm
  (`npm i -g ihsg-cli`, `npx ihsg-cli`); the command is still `idx`. The
  release workflow publishes both on every tag once `CRATES_PUBLISH` /
  `NPM_PUBLISH` are enabled (token secret or Trusted Publishing).
- Ownership data pipeline: `.github/workflows/ownership.yml` and
  `scripts/ownership_mirror.py` mirror every IDX "Pemegang Saham di Atas 1%"
  workbook to the `ownership-data` prerelease, with `index.json` (original
  URL, SHA-256, counts) and parsed JSON parts. idx.co.id blocks cloud
  networks, so the job runs on a self-hosted runner (`OWNERSHIP_RUNNER`); on
  GitHub's runners it only alarms when the mirror is 45 days stale. The
  mirror holds every register from February to September 2026.
- The web terminal loads the register by itself from that release (one
  verified part per minute, newest six months, D1 write budget); new
  `/api/ownership/status`. The manual `web/scripts/ownership-sync.mjs` is gone.
- `idx ownership import --latest|--all` and `discover` fall back to the GitHub
  mirror when idx.co.id refuses the request, checking each file's SHA-256;
  `IDX_OWNERSHIP_MIRROR` overrides or disables it, `IDX_OWNERSHIP_SOURCE`
  forces either side. `file://` URLs are accepted.
  `idx.ownership.discover.v1` entries gain `origin`, `sha256`, `source_url`.

### Changed

- Logo: the wordmark is now "IHSG" with the tagline "Indonesian market data
  for people and agents".
- Web ownership rows now carry nationality, domicile and scripless/scrip
  share counts like the CLI.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-17

### Added

- `idx mcp setup <client>`: the registration command or config snippet for
  25 agent harnesses (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, OpenAI Codex, Meta Muse
  Code, Google Antigravity, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot CLI, VS Code, Cursor,
  Windsurf, Kiro, JetBrains, Zed, Cline/Roo/Kilo, Continue, OpenCode, Goose,
  Warp, Factory Droid, Mistral Vibe, Qwen Code, Crush, Trae, Augment, and the
  remote-only products), with the binary's absolute path filled in; `--npx`
  and `--http URL --token T` variants; `-o json` for scripts.
- `idx mcp --http ADDR [--token T] [--allowed-host H]`: the same 20 tools
  over MCP streamable HTTP at `/mcp` for ChatGPT, Claude.ai connectors,
  Perplexity, Devin, Manus and other URL-only clients. Bearer auth, Host
  allow-list, `/healthz`.
- README and docs/mcp.md: install guide per agent.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-17

### Added

- `stocks brief SYMBOL` and MCP `idx_brief`: quote, verdict, signal, returns
  vs IHSG, dividend facts, top holders and headlines in one call, with
  plain-language `key_points` and a `sections_failed` list.
- `stocks dividends SYMBOL` / `idx_dividends`: Yahoo chart events
  (`events=div,splits`), yearly totals, TTM total and yield, payout streak.
- `stocks returns SYMBOLS` / `idx_returns`: 1w..5y and YTD returns, CAGR,
  volatility, max drawdown, best/worst day, 52-week position, and excess over
  a benchmark index (`^JKSE` by default). Index codes now parse everywhere.
- `market overview` / `idx_market`: IHSG, breadth, turnover, gainers, losers,
  most traded, heavyweights.
- `ownership foreign [SYMBOL]` / `idx_ownership_foreign`: disclosed foreign vs
  local stake per issuer over time, or every issuer's change between months.
- `ownership changes --offset` paging and a `summary` block (counts, foreign/
  local and investor-type net, issuer flow, top rises and falls) over every
  match; rows carry `local_foreign`.
- `-o csv` for every command.
- `idx watch add|rm|list|clear|returns` and `idx watch` for a local watchlist.
- Web terminal and landing page at https://ihsg.midoriresearch.com with a
  minute-refreshed D1 snapshot API (`web/`), now serving the new endpoints
  (`dividends`, `returns`, `brief`, `ownership/foreign`) too.

### Changed

- `stocks news SYMBOL` lists the company's headlines first and then fills the
  limit with market headlines (`scope` field, `company_matches`);
  `--company-only` restores the strict filter. Sentiment uses company items only.
- MCP tool input schemas are rewritten into the subset every harness accepts
  (no `$schema`, no `format`, no nullable type arrays), so the tools register
  in Gemini and OpenAI-strict clients as well as Claude.
- README logo respects GitHub dark mode and no longer clips its tagline.

### Fixed

- npm wrapper: npm 12 blocks dependency install scripts by default, so the
  package arrived without a binary. The launcher now downloads and verifies
  the binary on first run when postinstall did not.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-17

### Added

- `stocks quote <SYMBOLS>`: delayed quotes with price, change, OHLC, volume,
  market cap, P/E, dividend yield and more, from Yahoo Finance. Falls back to
  the chart endpoint (reduced fields) when the quote endpoint is unavailable.
- `stocks history <SYMBOL> --period --interval --limit`: OHLCV candles with a
  summary line.
- `-o json`: stable envelope (`idx.quotes.v1`, `idx.history.v1`) with
  provenance (`provider`, `fetched_at`, `cached`, `stale`, `warnings`).
- `idx schema <name>`: JSON Schema for every JSON shape.
- Local response cache with per-endpoint TTL, `--offline`, `--no-cache`, and
  `idx cache stats|clear|path`.
- `stocks screen --filter "pe<15,roe>15,sector=financial"`: screener over the
  bundled IDX universe (955 issuers, `data/universe.csv`). Quote-level keys
  come from batched Yahoo quotes; fundamentals keys from per-company calls
  capped at `--max-fundamentals` (largest first). Reports how many tickers
  each stage kept.
- `stocks news [SYMBOL]` and `stocks sentiment SYMBOL`: Kontan and CNBC
  Indonesia RSS feeds, ticker/company-name matching, transparent lexicon
  sentiment (terms are listed). Bisnis.com is opt-in because it blocks
  non-browser clients.
- MCP tools `idx_screen`, `idx_news`, `idx_sentiment`.
- `ownership import|ticker|entity|changes|releases|discover|path`: KSEI's
  monthly "Pemegang Saham di Atas 1%" register parsed from the IDX XLSX (or
  the older PDF text layer) into local SQLite, with entity-name normalisation
  so spelling variants of one holder group together. Downloads try a
  browser-shaped request, then `curl-impersonate`, else explain the manual
  path (idx.co.id is behind Cloudflare).
- MCP tools `idx_ownership_ticker`, `idx_ownership_entity`,
  `idx_ownership_changes`, `idx_ownership_releases`.
- `idx mcp`: MCP server over stdio (rmcp) exposing `idx_quote`, `idx_history`,
  `idx_profile`, `idx_financials`, `idx_earnings`, `idx_fundamental`,
  `idx_technical` and `idx_compare`, each returning the `-o json` envelope.
- `stocks profile`, `stocks financials` (annual / quarterly / TTM), `stocks
  earnings`, `stocks fundamental` (ratios plus a transparent rule-based
  verdict), `stocks technical` (RSI, MACD, SMA/EMA, Bollinger, ATR, levels,
  trend, signal) and `stocks compare`.
- MSN Money provider (`--provider msn`): quotes, profile, fundamentals and
  analyst targets. `auto` now tries Yahoo then MSN and merges fundamentals
  field by field, never averaging.
- Yahoo quoteSummary and fundamentals-timeseries endpoints.
- `web/`: Cloudflare Worker serving the landing page at
  https://ihsg.midoriresearch.com, reachable on the custom domain only.
- Config file with `idx config init|set|get|path`; precedence flags > env > file > defaults.
- Shell completions for bash, zsh, fish, PowerShell and elvish.
- Stable exit codes (0 ok, 2 usage, 3 network/provider, 4 not found,
  5 offline cache miss, 6 config).
